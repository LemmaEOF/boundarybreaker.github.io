<h3>Introducing...</h3>
<h1>The Stefan Karl #1 Collab Album!</h1>
<p>Stefan Karl, actor of Robbie Rotten, currently has pancreatic cancer. His friends on the LazyTown show have started a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/2tm9tqk">gofundme</a> for him, and we want to help out.</p>
<p>To do that, we're making an album. The album is going to be full of the highest quality LazyTown rips, and every cent from it will go towards Stefan's gofundme. However, before we can publish an album, we need rips, and we want your help.</p>
<p>If you want to submit a rip, send it to <code><a href="mailto:goclonefilms@gmail.com">goclonefilms@gmail.com</a></code> as a <code>.flac</code>, <code>.wav</code>, or <code>.aif</code> file, so it can be added to the album. Along with it, include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The actual name of the rip (not the name of the base track)</li>
  <li>The name you want to be called on the album</li>
  <li>A message to Stefan Karl, which will be sent to him. (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>A few guidelines to submitted rips and the album in general:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As this is a fundraising album, it will not be supplied for free. Though we won't stop you from sharing copies, it's a dick move.</li>
  <li>All rips submitted should have some LazyTown joke in them, and should follow basic quality guidelines (Sounds good unless sounding bad is part of the joke, isn't a screamer or excessively repetitive, etc).</li>
  <li>Your rip doesn't have to be published on TimmyTurnersGrandDad or TimrnyTurnersDad to be accepted, so feel free to submit ones you haven't sent there yet.</li>
  <li>Title the email "#1 Collab Album submission" so it isn't lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to be as transparent as possible with how the money is used. In order to get the money from bandcamp to the gofundme, it will have to go from Bandcamp to the TimrnyTurnersDad paypal, then to the personal debit card of one of the TTD admins, B0undarybreaker. Once it's there, it can be sent through WePay to Stefan's campaign. Since PayPal takes a transaction fee, she will be making that fee up out of her own pocket. She will provide proof of transaction at each step of the way to confirm that none of the money is kept in TTD pockets.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the album, rip submissions, the payment process, or anything else, email <code><a href="mailto:goclonefilms@gmail.com">goclonefilms@gmail.com</a></code>.</p>
